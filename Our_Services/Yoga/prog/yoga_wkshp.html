			<span class="word">Yoga</span> workshops at PowerZone are designed with an overall holistic approach to Yoga and Yogic Practices, as they are mainly focussed on imparting the ancient knowledge as mentioned in the scriptures, which constitutes the theoretical aspect of all the asanas and other yogic practices that we know today.<br><br>	We, at PowerZone, believe that knowing the inner significance of the yogic poses and their effects on various parts of our body is as important as physically practicing them, as it gives an individual the power to make a conscious choice as to which yogic practice would be most beneficial to him/her depending on his/her body constituency or what we call 'boundary conditions' in engineering terms.<br><br>
			Yoga workshops with some specific agenda are usually conducted during weekends. Normally they are 3-10 hour program for one day or spread across 2 weekends. Workshop will be on some key topics and are designed in such a way that it can be integrated in to one’s lifestyle easily. We even conduct many workshops specific to some specific ailments. These workshop can be conducted at our Yoga institute in Bangalore or at other locations depending on the requirement and availability of our teacher. The workshop can be customized based on the interest and requirement.<br><br>
			<strong>Target audience:</strong><br>
			1. Those living far from the center to attend our regular classes<br>
			2. Those who are busy during weekdays to commit for a scheduled time<br>
			3. Those who want access to quality scientific/logical teaching of Yoga.
